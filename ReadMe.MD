A little project to implement, in C#, some classes to represent deep neural networks, and to play with the MNIST hand written character data.  This is DNN 101 really but finding somewhere that represents gradient descent - especially with respect to the hidden layers - meant I had to implement it to see how it works.

So far, no gradient descent but does activation to some extent.  No representation for an actual DNN - just layers and stuff.

Here's a nice resource that explains what's going on - which I used extensively:

Worth a look.
